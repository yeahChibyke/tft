For individuals wishing to deconstruct their PDFs without difficulty, here's a simple solution without any technical difficulty.

## Reasons To Split PDF Files?
* **Organized Content**: You can quickly extract pages from larger PDFs to create smaller, more focused documents that make it easier to find and share specific information.
* **Efficient Sharing**: To improve communication, divide a document into its relevant pages and share them only, rather than sending the entire document at once.
